Doodhbazar is a distinctive platform where dairy farmers and milk suppliers can manage their accounts seamlessly. By creating an account, they can register their customers, record daily milk entries, and specify whether the milk is from cows or buffaloes, including details on milk by fat content. Users have the flexibility to make individual entries ranging from 1 to 50 via a wishlist or use the masterlist feature for up to 500 entries at once.

The platform allows for a detailed overview of profits and losses through a user-friendly dashboard. Doodhbazar is built on a foundation of Core PHP (using a template system), MySQL, JavaScript, and HTML CSS. To ensure security, a code has been implemented in image.php to protect the images directory. Additionally, the project enables users to capture their profile pictures through a webcam. Doodhbazar stands out as a remarkable and cherished project of mine.
