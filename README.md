Doodhbazar is a distinctive platform where dairy farmers and milk suppliers can manage their accounts seamlessly. By creating an account, they can register their customers, record daily milk entries, and specify whether the milk is from cows or buffaloes, including details on milk by fat content. Users have the flexibility to make individual entries ranging from 1 to 50 via a wishlist or use the masterlist feature for up to 500 entries at once.
